The solution to the First Homework is uploaded under the name **MSE_project**. The directory is the entire **python environment** where the said program was executed. The python program is saved as **final.py**. In this project directory you will find all the **raw data** extracted from www.Mse.mk under the name **All_Stock_Data**, where the data for each stock is saved as a separate file. The **processed data** is saved in the directory with name: **Processed_Data**.

The fastest run of the program was recorded at **63.4 seconds**, where we were using ethernet for fast connection. You can find the log in this directory by the name: **program-logs fastest-run**. As it was just a test of a bug fix we werent expecting a new best time run, we didnt record the specific run. In this version we werent logging the processing of files.

Video Recording of the program execution can be found here:[ https://github.com/EdonFetaji/DAS-Homework1/blob/main/link_to_video_recording.md](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DdQXQffiAWb_i6Wqca8mMHxuencOGKMU/view). In which the fastest run time was recorded at **69.21 seconds**.
The logs of the program for this specific run can be found here:
